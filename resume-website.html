  <p>Here is just one poem to give you an idea of what I can do.</p>

  <p>Her</p>

  <p>Blue sneakers and white dress,</p>
  <p>An angel, may God bless,</p>
  <p>The day I laid my eyes on her.</p>
  <p>Big smile and an empty stare,</p>
  <p>One look and she left me bare.</p>
  <p>The day I talked to her.</p>
  <p>Soft hands and dry lips,</p>
  <p>It was in the way she moved her hips,</p>
  <p>The day I saw her dance.</p>
  <p>Scar on her leg,</p>
  <p>All I could do was beg,</p>
  <p>The day she left me for dead.</p>
