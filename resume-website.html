 <h1 class="header">About me</h1>
 <p>My name is Rachel Ayateke, I am 18 years old Rwandese. I love learning new thigs about all kinds of subjects.
 I love listening to podcasts, reading articles about different topics and writing poetry.</p>
 <p>I discovered coding when I was 14, ad from that moment <span class="start">I fell in love with it.</span></p>
 <p>I decided to take this programming class for many reasons. Mainly it was because all the coding experience I have ever had was just basic.
   Imagine tasting a very good dish but never having the opportunity to eat it all. So before I signed up for four years of college programming I wanted to have a sense of what coding is really about.
  Thus applying to Moringa school, to know if I really want to be a programmer.</p>
 <p>I am still young and I know I have alot to learn especially regarding coding but on this page I am sharing the few things I have learnt so far.</p>

  <h4 class="header">Hobby: Poetry</h4>
  <p>Here is just one poem to give you an idea of what I can do.</p>

  <p>Her</p>

  <p>Blue sneakers and white dress,</p>
  <p>An angel, may God bless,</p>
  <p>The day I laid my eyes on her.</p>
  <p>Big smile and an empty stare,</p>
  <p>One look and she left me bare.</p>
  <p>The day I talked to her.</p>
  <p>Soft hands and dry lips,</p>
  <p>It was in the way she moved her hips,</p>
  <p>The day I saw her dance.</p>
  <p>Scar on her leg,</p>
  <p>All I could do was beg,</p>
  <p>The day she left me for dead.</p>
