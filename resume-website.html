 <h1 class="header">About me</h1>
 <p>My name is Rachel Ayateke, I am 18 years old Rwandese. I love learning new thigs about all kinds of subjects.
 I love listening to podcasts, reading articles about different topics and writing poetry.</p>
 <p>I discovered coding when I was 14, ad from that moment <span class="start">I fell in love with it.</span></p>
 <p>I decided to take this programming class for many reasons. Mainly it was because all the coding experience I have ever had was just basic.
   Imagine tasting a very good dish but never having the opportunity to eat it all. So before I signed up for four years of college programming I wanted to have a sense of what coding is really about.
  Thus applying to Moringa school, to know if I really want to be a programmer.</p>
 <p>I am still young and I know I have alot to learn especially regarding coding but on this page I am sharing the few things I have learnt so far.</p>
