  <div class="sidebar">My name is Rachel Ayateke, I am 18 years old Rwandese. I love learning new thigs about all kinds of subjects.
  I love listening to podcasts, reading articles about different topics and writing poetry.I discovered coding when I was 14, ad from that moment I fell in love with it.

   <div class="column">
    I decided to take this programming class for many reasons.
    Mainly it was because all the coding experience I have ever had was just basic.
    Imagine tasting a very good dish but never having the opportunity to eat it all.
    So before I signed up for four years of college programming I wanted to have a sense of what coding is really about.
    Thus applying to Moringa school, to know if I really want to be a programmer.I am still young and I know I have alot to learn especially regarding coding but on this page I am sharing the few things I have learnt so far.
